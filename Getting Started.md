# Getting Started

<em>Welcome to the [Product Name]. The [Product Name] is an ecosystem of integrated software tools and infrastructure that aims to standardize the end-to-end data science workflow, including data exploration, analysis, model development, deployment, and life cycle management. This document is intended to help you get onboarded so that you can start your first workspace and begin accessing the data and tools you need, all on the cloud.</em>

## The [Product] is comprised of three parts.
The [Product] utilizes:
<ul>
  <li>A data science platform, Domino, to help you access and manage your data.</li>
  <li> GitHub, to add and work with Git repositories.</li>
  <li>An IDE to help you work with your code, such as Jupyter or RStudio</li>
</ul>

During this onboarding process, you will learn how to set up the prerequisites needed to perform your work, how to select an IDE, and set up your access to GitHub.

> The original document for this topic continues into several additional sections for each of the topics above. Please see the next sample file, "Setting Up Access to GitHub" to view what the writing and formatting might look like for a particular topic.
